# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The project purpose was to create a DataFrame for the different city types fares and create a plot for analysis.   The three city type
are urban, suburban, and rural.

## Results

The first chart shows a comparison between the three city types.  The chart shows a large number of rides in the urban area.   This is a 10x greater
number of rides than the smallest rural type.   This correlated closly with the number of drivers for both.  The urban area had a much larger amount
of drivers by 20x compared to the rural area.   The average fare per ride was slightly higher in the rural area compared to both the urban and
suburban areas.   Since the amount of drivers in the rural area was less, the average fare per driver was greater for rural.
